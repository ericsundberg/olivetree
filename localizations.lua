Many thanks for the huge support, testing, feedback and help from many others. An especially large thanks goes to the alpha testers, and also members of the community Discord server, and those who gave feedback on the devlog videos on YouTube. I couldn't have made Sapiens without you.

And most of all, thank you to my amazing wife Emma, who supported our family and me through this very long period of development, sacrificing her own career to give me the time to work on mine. This game is every bit as much the result of Emma's hard work, sacrifice, and dedication as it is mine.
